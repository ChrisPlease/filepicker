# FilePicker Directives

This is a File Picker Directive that uses a service inspired by [this post](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2013/07/03/building-a-filereader-service-for-angularjs-the-service.aspx).

I also wrote a second directive that takes the data from the filepicker, and inserts a resized and cropped image. 

Working CodePen example can be found [here](http://codepen.io/ChrisPlz/pen/eNwwvN)

Not sure if any other crop works except for my particular use case. Only tested on Chrome.
